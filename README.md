# Object-Detection-with-Edge-Computing-on-Jetson-Nano
Developed a real-time object detection system using OpenCV on Jetson Nano. Implemented a cascade classifier to identify environmental objects and flag suspicious activities. Integrated edge computing for on-device processing, reducing latency and dependency on cloud services.
